# T3 Gallery
A full-stack image gallery application built with the T3 Stack, featuring secure authentication, cloud database integration, and automated error tracking.

> This project has been archived and moved to a read-only state. Following the disclosure of CVE-2025-55182 regarding React Server Components, I have shifted my focus to developing web applications using Java with Spring Boot for enhanced backend stability and security.

# Tech Stack

* Framework: Next.js (App Router)

* Language: TypeScript

* Styling: Tailwind CSS

* Database: Vercel Postgres with Drizzle ORM
